**RecDCL** is a dual CL method for recommendation, which investigates the relationship of objectives between batch-wise CL (BCL) and feature-wise CL (FCL). Our study suggests a cooperative benefit of employing both methods, as evidenced from theoretical and experimental perspectives. RecDCL first eliminates redundant solutions on user-item positive pairs in a feature-wise manner. It then optimizes the uniform distributions within users and items using a polynomial kernel from an FCL perspective. Finally, it generates contrastive embedding on output vectors in a batch-wise objective. RecDCL achieves more competitive performance than the state-of-the-art GNNs-based and SSL-based models (with up to a 5.65\% improvement in terms of Recall@20).
